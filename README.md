# softphone demo

This is a proof of concept for WebRTC softphone using [46elks.com
API](https://46elks.com/). The frontend code is based on [46elks example
code](https://github.com/46elks/46elks-getting-started/tree/master/code-examples/WebRTC).

This demo is deployed to [phone.logit.net](https://phone.logit.net/).
Beware that calls (both incoming and outgoing) are logged to a file
which may periodically be deleted (check the source). If you don't want
your calls to be logged, deploy the demo to your own server.

Feel free to contact me for any questions on the matter.
